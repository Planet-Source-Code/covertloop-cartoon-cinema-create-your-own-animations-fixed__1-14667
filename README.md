### Description

(Fixed the 'Open Dialog' problem)

A fully functional cartoon script creator for MS Agent. Simply select the character, tell it what to do, and add it to the script. This software allows all 4 characters (Genie, Merlin, Peedy, and Robby) to interact with each other however you want them to. Create your script and watch these characters bring it to life! A brief tutorial on how to use this program is explained by the Genie character at startup. Comments and Suggestions are welcome, but DON'T FORGET TO VOTE!!!
